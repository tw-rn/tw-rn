title: React Native Web Responsive Design

This principle is the same as Tailwind. This feature only works for React Native Web.

You can use it as you would use it in web but with React Native Components:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```jsx
<View 
  style={tw`bg-red-500 sm:bg-green-500 md:bg-blue-500 lg:bg-pink-500 xl:bg-teal-500`}
/>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
