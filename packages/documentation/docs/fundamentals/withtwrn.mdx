The Higher order Component `withTwrn` determines what is the correct style to apply that comes from the `tw` function and passes down to the underlying component.

This is the Typescript signature of the HoC:

```typescript
const withTwrn: <P extends object, O extends keyof P>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>,
  styleKeys: O[]
) => React.ComponentType<VariantProps<P, O>>;
```

This is how the `View` component is wraped inside this library:

```js
import * as RN from "react-native";

export const View = withTwrn(RN.View, ["style"]);
```

The first parameter is the Component to be wrapped and the second is the style prop to be used by tw-rn.

### Using tw-rn for styling an external Component that uses regular React Native styles.

You can easily use this component to use the `tw` function whenever you need.

<!-- tw.raw`bg-gray-500` -->
<!-- tw.value`bg-gray-500`; -->

```jsx
import { withTwrn, View, Text } from "tw-rn";
import ExternalComponent as OriginalExternalComponent from 'external-library';

// Wrap component with withTwrn and specify which prop contains the style
const ExternalComponent = withTwrn(OriginalExternalComponent, ['styleProp']);

// Usage
<ExternalComponent styleProp={tw`bg-white p-4`} />
```
